# Alephium Stats Dashboard

This Proof of Concept app was developed for the first [Alephium Hackathon](https://alephium.org/hackathon/) and shows different stats of the Alephium Blockchain.

It provides a simple but clean interface for different stats. Our backend can be expanded, so it allows to incorporate third party APIs, rate limits & user authentication and a role concept.

## Getting Started

Copy ```.env.example``` to ```.env.local```
The API is public for now and accessible with ```API_KEY=123456```


Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
